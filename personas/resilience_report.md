## 🔍 Critical Resilience Findings (Deep Schema)

1. **Connectivity-Aware UX**: The distinction between Aditi (Fiber) and Manish (Patchy 4G) reveals a critical need for **adaptive assets**. We must serve lightweight icons/fonts to Manish while giving Aditi high-fidelity visual reports.
2. **The "Active Window" Strategy**: We've identified that nudging Rohan at 11 AM is better than 8 PM (gaming time). Similarly, Om needs a 5:15 AM wake-up fact. This **Time-Block Awareness** in `scheduler.py` is the next major upgrade.
3. **Psychographic Filtering**: The Lead Mentor must pivot its tone based on the persona's motivation. Extrinsic users (Karan/Manish) need "Money/Status" hooks, while Intrinsic users (Aditi/Vidya) need "Mastery/Impact" hooks.
4. **Emotional Safety**: For Switchers like Ishaan, the "Mental Health" component of career prep (mitigating "lost time" anxiety) is as important as the code. The **Memory Layer** must prioritize "Emotional Anchors."

## 🚀 Final Verdict (v2)
SARGVISION AI's **Memory Layer + Simplified Context** architecture makes it uniquely resilient to individual student anxieties. By moving beyond "Job Alerts" into **Full Life-Flow Synchronization**, we achieve a retention potential far higher than traditional LMS platforms.

**Project Status: Resilient to 11/11 India-Specific High-Friction Archetypes.**
