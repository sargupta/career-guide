# Persona 04: Ishaan — The Late-Bloom Switcher
**Archetype**: Career Pivoter, Catching Up, FOMO-Prone

## 👤 Core Bio & Environment
- **Background**: 22, 4th Year Mechanical Engineering, State Engineering College (Tier-2, Pune).
- **Device & Connection**: Mid-range Android (Samsung), Steady Wi-Fi (Hostel).
- **Time Blocks**: Active 9 PM – 11 PM (Post-classes); 2 PM – 3 PM (Afternoon lull). Receptive at 9:30 PM (When FOMO hits while seeing friends' LinkedIn updates).

## 🧠 Psychographics & Processing
- **Learning Style**: Narrative/Tutorial-first. Needs to see the "Bridge" between old and new skills.
- **Motivation**: Extrinsic (Wants to catch up to CSE salaries) mixed with Intrinsic (Found an actual passion for UI Design).
- **Information Density**: Step-by-step. Needs "The Transition Guide."

## 📉 Emotional & Social Profile
- **Primary Anxiety**: "I've wasted 3.5 years in the wrong branch."
- **Confidence Level**: 5/10 (Confident in general logic, but zero confidence in design aesthetics).
- **Social Context**: Feels "behind" his peers; follows tech-influencers on X/Twitter; high pressure to secure a "Non-Core" job.

## 🔔 Nudge & Interaction Preferences
- **Tone**: "Supportive Strategist" (Logical, bridge-focused, reassuring: "Ishaan, your Mechanical logic in 'Systems Thinking' is a 90% match for UX Information Architecture. Let's prove it today.").
- **Nudge Channel**: WhatsApp & Dashboard.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Progress bars that show "Skills Transferred" from his old domain.

## 📊 Digital Twin Stats (Mock)
- **Primary Domain**: Product Design / UX Research.
- **Readiness Score**: 28%.
- **Skill Radar**: Visual Design (45%), Design Thinking (30%), Analytical Solving (80%), Prototyping (20%).

## 🛑 The Friction Points
1. **The Time Crunch**: 6-month paths feel like a lifetime; he needs "What can I do this week?"
2. **Abstract Concepts**: He needs concrete analogies (e.g., "Designing a UI is like designing a gear-train; consistency is the lubrication.").
3. **Tutorial Hell**: Spends too much time watching, zero time "Logging." Needs a nudge to "Build, don't just watch."

## 🤖 AI Agent Implementation (Memory Hooks)
- **Top 3 Memory Facts**:
  1. Has a strong background in AutoCAD/Mechanical logic (Use this as an anchor).
  2. High anxiety about "lost time" (Address this in mentor tone).
  3. Prefers step-by-step actionables over theoretical design philosophy.
- **MCP Hook Priority**: **GitHub** (Design systems review) > **SkillingCoach** (The Switcher Path).

## 🏆 Success Definition
Ishaan completes a small bridge project and the AI identifies how his "Engineering Precision" made the UI better. He stops feeling "behind."
