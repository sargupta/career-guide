# Persona 02: Aditi — The MAANG Aspirant
**Archetype**: Competitive IT Career, LC/System Design Focused, Goal: Top-Tier Tech

## 👤 Core Bio & Environment
- **Background**: 20, 3rd Year B.Tech CSE, IIT Delhi.
- **Device & Connection**: High-end (MacBook Air M2 / iPhone 15), Fiber Broadband (300Mbps).
- **Time Blocks**: Active 8 AM (Prep for day), 4 PM (Lab breaks), 11 PM (Late-night deep work). Most receptive to precision data at 8:15 AM.

## 🧠 Psychographics & Processing
- **Learning Style**: Text-heavy, High-density. Prefers deep documentation over "Intro" videos.
- **Motivation**: Intrinsic (Driven by mastery and high-stakes competition).
- **Information Density**: Maximum. Needs all stats, source citations, and "why."

## 📉 Emotional & Social Profile
- **Primary Anxiety**: Peer competition (FOMO on specific niche internships / elite club entries).
- **Confidence Level**: 9/10 (Expert in her field; only respects "Elite" level AI advice).
- **Social Context**: Immersed in LinkedIn "Hustle Culture," GitHub stars, and elite alumni networks.

## 🔔 Nudge & Interaction Preferences
- **Tone**: "Executive Partner" (Direct, data-backed, high-tempo: "Aditi, 3 new HFT internships matched your profile in the last hour. Detailed breakdown below.").
- **Nudge Channel**: Dashboard/Push notifications (WhatsApp is secondary/social).
- **Micro-Interactions**: Minimalist utility; fast-loading data tables; "Efficiency" metrics.

## 📊 Digital Twin Stats (Mock)
- **Primary Domain**: Quantitative Finance / Software Engineering.
- **Readiness Score**: 78%.
- **Skill Radar**: DSA (95%), System Design (60%), Tech Writing (80%), Leadership (70%).

## 🛑 The Friction Points
1. **The "Flashy" Filter**: She finds emoji-heavy mentor tones condescending.
2. **AI Latency**: 5-second wait times are seen as a failure of system design.
3. **Generic Advice**: If the AI suggests "Practice DSA," she disengages instantly.

## 🤖 AI Agent Implementation (Memory Hooks)
- **Top 3 Memory Facts**:
  1. Already has 3 internships (Skip entry-level career advice).
  2. Targeting $150k+ HFT roles specifically.
  3. Uses a specific Tech Stack (Rust/Go); don't suggest MERN.
- **MCP Hook Priority**: **GitHub** (Repo review) > **LiveWebScout** (High-fidelity career tracking).

## 🏆 Success Definition
Aditi finds a niche internship or open-source project that wasn't on the general job boards, giving her an "Information Edge."
