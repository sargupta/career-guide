# Persona 10: Om — The Disciplined Govt Aspirant
**Archetype**: Exam-Focused, High Discipline, Monotony-Resistant

## 👤 Core Bio & Environment
- **Background**: 22, Final Year BSc Agriculture, Tier-3 (Jabalpur).
- **Device & Connection**: Mid-range Android, 4G (Utilitarian usage).
- **Time Blocks**: Active 5 AM – 8 AM (Morning study); 9 PM – 11 PM (Revision). Receptive at 5:15 AM (Needs the day's roadmap).

## 🧠 Psychographics & Processing
- **Learning Style**: Facts / Bullets / Checklists. "Is this relevant for the SSC CGL exam?"
- **Motivation**: Extrinsic (Stability for family; Social status; the 'Job for Life').
- **Information Density**: High on facts, Zero on fluff. Needs "The Exam Summary."

## 📉 Emotional & Social Profile
- **Primary Anxiety**: "Success is binary (Pass/Fail). What if I fail the 1% selection?"
- **Confidence Level**: 7/10 (In discipline), 2/10 (In 'Plan B' career options).
- **Social Context**: Local coaching center culture; family support contingent on "The Exam"; very traditional success metrics.

## 🔔 Nudge & Interaction Preferences
- **Tone**: "Strict Disciplined Coach" (Direct, structured, metric-led: "Om, you've covered 85% of 'Economy' syllabus. The remaining 15% (GST/VAT) is 2 days overdue. Start with this 5-minute summary?").
- **Nudge Channel**: WhatsApp (Morning Alarm style).
- **Micro-Interactions**: Direct "Checklist" completion; syllabus progress bars; day-counting timers.

## 📊 Digital Twin Stats (Mock)
- **Primary Domain**: UPSC / SSC CGL / Bank PO.
- **Readiness Score**: 55%.
- **Skill Radar**: GS (85%), Quant (70%), Logic (75%), Interview (15%).

## 🛑 The Friction Points
1. **Non-Exam Distractions**: If the app suggests "Coding" or "Creative Writing," he deletes it.
2. **Hidden Value**: He needs to see how his UPSC study is also making him an "Internal Strategy" expert for corporate Plan B.
3. **App Complexity**: He's already fatigued. The UI must be a "Single Sheet" focus.

## 🤖 AI Agent Implementation (Memory Hooks)
- **Top 3 Memory Facts**:
  1. Zero tolerance for non-exam tasks (Pivot all advice to exam relevance).
  2. Extremely disciplined (Can handle high-workload nudges).
  3. Needs Plan B reassurance (Privately map his study to high-value corpo skills).
- **MCP Hook Priority**: **SimplificationAgent** (NCERT/M Laxmikanth) > **NewsScout** (Current Affairs).

## 🏆 Success Definition
Om masters a complex topic that usually takes 3 hours in 30 minutes via the AI's simplification. He logs it in his "Syllabus Tracker" and gets his 5:15 AM WhatsApp Roadmap.
