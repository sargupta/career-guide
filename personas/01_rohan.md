# Persona 01: Rohan — The Distracted Gamer
**Archetype**: Low Focus, Non-Tech, Extrinsic Discovery

## 👤 Core Bio & Environment
- **Background**: 19, 2nd Year BA History, Tier-3 Govt College (Indore).
- **Device & Connection**: Low-end Android (Redmi), patchy 4G/Daily Data Cap (1.5GB/day). 
- **Time Blocks**: Active 10 PM – 2 AM (Gaming); 9 AM – 11 AM (Travel). High receptivity to nudges at 11:30 AM (Post-lecture boredom).

## 🧠 Psychographics & Processing
- **Learning Style**: Visual/Video (YouTube Shorts style preferred). Skips long text.
- **Motivation**: Extrinsic (Wants a "laptop job" to prove others wrong; salary for gaming upgrades).
- **Information Density**: Simplification-first. Needs "The 1-minute pitch."

## 📉 Emotional & Social Profile
- **Primary Anxiety**: "Will I end up back in my village?"
- **Confidence Level**: 3/10 (High imposter syndrome in English/Tech).
- **Social Context**: Heavily influenced by Discord gaming communities and Instagram "get-rich-quick" clips.

## 🔔 Nudge & Interaction Preferences
- **Tone**: "Supportive Gamer Peer" (Casual, emoji-heavy: "Ayo Rohan, your streak is at risk! 🍿").
- **Nudge Channel**: WhatsApp (95% usage).
- **Micro-Interactions**: RPG-style XP bar animations; "Achievement Unlocked" notifications.

## 📊 Digital Twin Stats (Mock)
- **Primary Domain**: Game Support / Social Media Management.
- **Readiness Score**: 12%.
- **Skill Radar**: Content Creation (40%), Tech Fluency (5%), Reasoning (15%), Comm (25%).

## 🛑 The Friction Points
1. **The "Homework" Fallacy**: Formal forms lead to instant 100% abandonment.
2. **Short-Term High**: Valorant rewards are instant; career prep feels like a "delayed win."
3. **Jargon Blindness**: Technical terms like "Backend" or "SDK" cause immediate disengagement.

## 🤖 AI Agent Implementation (Memory Hooks)
- **Top 3 Memory Facts**:
  1. Lives on a data cap (No heavy video downloads).
  2. Passionate about Valorant (Bridge concepts to gaming logic).
  3. Struggles with English (Use Hinglish and simple analogies).
- **MCP Hook Priority**: **NewsScout** (Low-barrier current affairs) > **OpportunityScout** (Entry-level gigs).

## 🏆 Success Definition
Rohan logs a 2-minute daily "Quest" and sees his "XP bar" jump to 15%. He feels the system "gets" his gamer brain.
