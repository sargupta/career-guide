# Persona 07: Vidya — The Global Researcher
**Archetype**: Academic Research, PhD/R&D Path, International Scholar Track

## 👤 Core Bio & Environment
- **Background**: 20, 3rd Year B.Tech ECE, Tier-1.5 (Hyderabad).
- **Device & Connection**: High-end Laptop (Dell XPS), Stable Fiber Broadband. Phone is a high-end Android.
- **Time Blocks**: Active 9 AM – 6 PM (Continuous focus); 10 PM – 12 AM (Review). Receptive at 10:15 PM (Wants an academic summary of the day).

## 🧠 Psychographics & Processing
- **Learning Style**: Deep Text / Papers / Detailed long-form. Hates "oversimplification."
- **Motivation**: Intrinsic (Love for core engineering / Scientific curiosity).
- **Information Density**: Maximum. "Show me the data and the paper link."

## 📉 Emotional & Social Profile
- **Primary Anxiety**: "Will I be forced into a generalist software role because core jobs are fewer?"
- **Confidence Level**: 8/10 (Technically solid), 3/10 (Social networking Confidence).
- **Social Context**: Immersed in Academic Reddit, ResearchGate, and elite professor-led WhatsApp groups.

## 🔔 Nudge & Interaction Preferences
- **Tone**: "Senior Research Lead" (Neutral, logical, citation-heavy: "Vidya, a new IEEE paper on VLSI optimization matching your current project has just been flagged. Summary and impact below.").
- **Nudge Channel**: Dashboard & Email (WhatsApp is too noisy/informal for her).
- **Micro-Interactions**: Dark-mode syntax highlighting; technical project tracking; paper references.

## 📊 Digital Twin Stats (Mock)
- **Primary Domain**: Semiconductor Design / VLSI.
- **Readiness Score**: 65%.
- **Skill Radar**: Circuit Design (90%), Math Modeling (85%), Research (80%), Networking (15%).

## 🛑 The Friction Points
1. **The "Emoji" Filter**: Too many 🚀 and ✨ make her think the AI is a toy.
2. **Generalisation**: If the system suggests "Web Dev" because it's popular, she feels unheard.
3. **Networking Friction**: Asking her to "Network with alum" is an anxiety trigger. She needs "Here is a technical question you can ask this specific Alum."

## 🤖 AI Agent Implementation (Memory Hooks)
- **Top 3 Memory Facts**:
  1. Obsessed with Semiconductor physics (Focus all advice here).
  2. Planning for Masters abroad (Keep GRE/Research paper advice active).
  3. High technical threshold (Don't simplify the core tech; simplify the soft-skill steps).
- **MCP Hook Priority**: **RSS** (ArXiv feed) > **AcademicRadar** (Conference alerts).

## 🏆 Success Definition
Vidya finds an obscure Research Internship alert via the AI. The system helps her draft a cold-email that focuses on her technical project's "Citation-worthiness."
